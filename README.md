# Ruby-Black-Jack
A Game to show implementation of classes and objects. 


Currently, the game has some missing rules, such as Aces being value 1 or 11. The base form of the game works on CMD!

The cards drawn will have a suit, but currently there is no implementation to ensure that 2 of the same card cant be pulled.
